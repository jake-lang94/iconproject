<p>Awards like Most Valuable Player are commonplace in today's major sporting leagues, but their meaning and who is awarded is different in every league.  In MLB, it's become a mix of awarding statistical dominance as much as its also a reward for narrative-driven team success bestowed on the "most valuable player" - with every award in MLB given out based on a system of accreddited voting.  Though ballots and reasoning aren't made public by policy, much the debate around the topic engeders much discussion.  Of the discussion points most relevent is about WAR.  WAR, or Wins Above Replacement, is one of the most often referenced statistic in player and performance evaluation.  Essentially, the stat is an attempt to understand how much better an individual player is better then the average at their respective positions.  The statistic does not materially make a difference between position players and it's an easy way to understand compared to the esoteric SABRMetrics ever so colloquially used in baseball coverage and social chatter.</p>

<p>In humanistic terms, this sounds cold and callous, but the front office of a major league baseball franchise or the dashboard of a serious fantasy baseball player, WAR is great.  Instead of having to solely rely on things like "gut" and the "eye test", or more rudimentary stats like Batting Average or context-dependent stats like Runs Batted In, the WAR stat gives you a nice easy number to digest.  The stat is primarily calculated in two similar but different ways - one by Baseball-Reference (bWAR) and Fangraphs (fWAR).
  Both are considered official with preference being that of the analyst, and the calcualtions are more easily explained by those websites themseves. <br></p>

  <!--- below is the data/icon portion -->

<p>As of the end of the 2023 MLB regular season, Los Angeles Angeles of Anaheim pitcher and designated hitter Shohei Ohtani leads the way with WAR.  Ohtani is a once-in-a-generation player that both pitches and hits, and does so at an elite, historic rate.  With over 9.0, Ohtani is clearly the most valuable player in the American League.  On the other hand, Mookie Betts and Ronald Acu単a Jr. have made the National League MVP debate all that much richer as they finished the season with 8.3 each.

There's currently no unified MVP award offered by MLB.  These prestigous awards are given to both the American League and the National League teams each.  The labeling distinction of each allows more players to be recognized, but when it comes to the best overall? That's where WAR comes in. The "wins above replacement" idea is a mathimatical explanation yet simple enough statistic for baseball's most valuable player. 
 </p>  

<p>As of the end of 2023 regular season, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani has run away with the 9/10 WAR rating clearing the American League field.  When the off-season officially hits, the legendary two-way player is sure to court the richest deal in the sport's history - perhaps north of $600 million in the most optimistic projections.  He won't pitch for another year after receving Tommy John, but will still be swinging the bat.  </p>

<h2>National League</h2>

<p>Also in Los Angeles but in the National League, Mookie Betts played all over the diamond going between infield and outfield to an 8.3 and 8.4 in fWar and bWar respectively.  Atlanta's Ronald Acu単a Jr. on the otherhand made his mark with the first 40/70 season in history with 40 homeruns and 70 stolen bases.  He still shared the 8.3 with betts at Fangraphs, but still graded lower at 8.1 with baseball-reference. It'll be interesting to see who takes the award. Both Betts and Acu単a have teammates solidly occupying the 3/4 spots for MVP too with Freddie Freeman and Matt Olson - both first basemen</p>
